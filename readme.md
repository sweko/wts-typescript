# Welcome aboard the Typetanic: Unsinkable Strategies for Advanced TypeScript Types

## Overview

This repository contains materials for a presentation on some advanced TypeScript types topics. The talk aims to guide developers through complex typing scenarios and equip them with strategies to maintain robust TypeScript codebases.

## Topics Covered

- Quick refresher on TypeScript fundamentals
- Advanced type concepts
- Common pitfalls and how to avoid them
- Practical tips for managing complex type scenarios
- Best practices for maintaining TypeScript projects

## Target Audience

This presentation is suitable for both experienced TypeScript developers and curious newcomers looking to deepen their understanding of the language's type system.

## Getting Started

Just run `npm install` and you're good to go!

## Examples

The `working` directory contains a series of examples that demonstrate the concepts discussed in the presentation. Each example is self-contained and can be examined independently. Note that since the examples are designed to be illustrative, they may not be production-ready or runnable.

The `live` directory contains the code that was live-coded during the presentation. This code is a bit stream-of-consciousness and may not be as polished as the examples in the `working` directory.

### Basics Example

The basics example demonstrates some fundamental TypeScript concepts, such as type inference, type annotations, and type assertions.

### Omit Example

The omit example demonstrates how to create a utility type that omits specific properties from an object type. It displays type system features like generics, mapped types, conditional types, and the `keyof` operator.
